//Problem 14.* Print the ASCII Table

//Find online more information about ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program that prints the entire ASCII table of characters on the console(characters from 0 to 255).
//Note: Some characters have a special purpose and will not be displayed as expected.You may skip them or display them differently.

//Note: You may need to use for-loops (learn in Internet how).

            Console.Write(Convert.ToChar(i));
